## What is it
Standard Python lacks many popular data structures, such as BinaryHeap, BST, etc. This reposotory is 
an extension of the collections package in the standard Python.

## Available Data Strucure
### Heap
Implementation of binary heap using array list (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)). 
The object can be a list of any objects as long their values can be mutually compared.

## Contribution
I currently work by myself on this project and haven't yet thought about how to cooperate. But if you are interested to work together, 
you are more than welcome to contact me (ustcscgyer@gmail.com) so we can discuss about that. 

## Report Issues
There is no guarantee about the performance and the correctness of the implementations. If you encounter problems or if you have 
suggestions for improvement, please contact me (ustcscgyer@gmail.com).
